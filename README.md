## Overview

### The Challenge

The challenge was to build an FAQ accordion card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

Additionally, I aim to enhance my JavaScript skills by working on more complex interactive components and exploring modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries.
